The project is a travel planner app that has an admin login as well as a user login .This application helps a user to plan a 
trip according to their preference for the routes i.e once user enters start location and destination they can choose a preferable 
path for shortest distance or low cost or low travel time. It will also allow the user to see his previous trips or the 
user can also book pre-planned trips. Here, user will be able to find popular places to visit when they are on a trip. 
The admin can see all booked trips. He can add or delete a city from the list of cities. Also, the admin can schedule a trip for users. 

The project consists of different data structures like Graph , Linked List ,and Priority queue. Here, the graph is used to store the 
cities that act like vertices and the routes as edges. The main aim is to show the connections between cities for minimum cost, time and distance. 
We have implemented the Dijkstra algorithm using priority queue for finding the routes with optimal cost, time and distance. 
We have created linked list of trips which stores the passenger information and the previous trips they have travelled.
